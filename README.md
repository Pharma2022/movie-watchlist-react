# Quizzical Scrimba FrontEnd Module 10 - React Basics

Quick start:

$ npm run dev
````

This is a quiz application that uses a restful API from [omdb](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

See [Demo](https://shahs-moviewatchlist.netlify.app/)

## Functionality
- You can search for a movie with IMDB title or name

## Libaries that have been used
- React
- OMBB API for fetching
- Asynchronous functions 

## Stretch goals
- I coded this using React , but the origin project was a vanilla javasript project 

## Further Stretch Goals/General Improvements
- To refactor the CSS to make maintenance easier
- To refactor using context to reduce prop drilling
- To add React Router and use layout Routes
- Instead of local storage to use Firebase
